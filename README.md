## SentimentLens: Decoding Emotions in IMDB Movie Reviews with Deep Learning
A sentiment analysis model using Bidirectional LSTM, Attention Mechanism and pre-trained GloVe embeddings, implemented with Keras.

This project implements a Sentiment Analysis model using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with an Attention Mechanism. The model is trained on the IMDB movie reviews dataset and utilizes pre-trained GloVe embeddings to enhance word understanding.

## Project Overview
This project applies deep learning techniques to classify movie reviews based on their sentimentâ€”positive or negative. The model is trained using the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset, which contains 50,000 labeled reviews. Key components include:
- **Bidirectional LSTM** for learning sequential information from both directions of the text.
- **Attention Mechanism** to focus on important parts of the review.
- **Pre-trained GloVe Embeddings** for rich semantic representation of words.

## Model Architecture
The model consists of:
- **Embedding Layer**: Uses GloVe embeddings for word representations.
- **Bidirectional LSTM**: Captures long-term dependencies from both directions in the text.
- **Attention Layer**: Focuses on key parts of the input sequence to enhance performance.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers to process the output of the LSTM and Attention layers.
- **Output Layer**: Uses sigmoid activation for binary classification (positive or negative sentiment).

## Dataset

We use the [IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews), which consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative. The dataset is balanced with 25,000 positive and 25,000 negative reviews.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahul-vinay/SentimentLens.git
   cd SentimentLens
   
2. **Install the dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Download GloVe Embeddings**:
   ```bash
   wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
   
   unzip glove.6B.zip

## How to Run
1. **Run the Notebook**:   
- You can open the .ipynb file (e.g., SentimentLens.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- Follow the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

2. **Save and Load the Model**:
- After training, save the model:
  ```bash
  best_model.save('best_sentiment_model.keras')
  
- To load the model later:
  ```bash
  from keras.models import load_model
  
  model = load_model('best_sentiment_model.keras')

## Results:
The model achieved the following results on the test set:

- **Test Accuracy**: ~87.94%
  
- **Confusion Matrix**: Illustrates the classification performance.

  Some example outputs:

     
    review2 = "This movie is terrible. I hate it."
  
    sentiment2 = sentiment_prediction(review2)
  
    print(f"Review: {review2}\nSentiment: {sentiment2}")
    

![Negative Review](images/output1.png)



    review3 = "I would watch this movie again."

    sentiment3 = sentiment_prediction(review3)

    print(f"Review: {review3}\nSentiment: {sentiment3}")

## Future Work

- **Explore Transformer Models**: Implement BERT or GPT models to improve sentiment classification.
  
- **Data Augmentation**- Experiment with data augmentation techniques to enrich the training data.
